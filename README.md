# Project
An _unfinished_ roguelike game project with a _unique_ twist, developed in **Unity**.

## Features
I built numerous core systems for the game, including text box, minimap, VFX, weapon, inventory, combat, enemy, NPC, procedural level generation, and the player controller.\
I also created several custom Unity tools, inspectors, and visualization systems to streamline development.\
The current version is somewhat unstable as I was in the middle of migrating to a new VFX and Entity system — earlier builds may be more stable.\
All pixel art is hand-drawn by me (a programmer) using a mouse.

Here's an old demo with worse lighting and post-processing effects:

## Notes
I made this project back when I was a much less experienced programmer and designer.\
Between my inexperience, my growing dislike for Unity’s sluggish workflow, and eventual burnout, I don’t plan to continue this project anytime soon.\
If I ever pick it up again, I’d rebuild it from scratch in my own 2D engine.
