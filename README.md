# Vailoz
An _unfinished_ roguelike game project with a _unique_ twist.

I built numerous core systems for the game, including text box, minimap, VFX, weapon, inventory, combat, enemy, NPC, procedural level generation, and the player controller.\
I also created several custom Unity tools, inspectors, and visualization systems to streamline development.\
The current version is somewhat unstable as I was in the middle of migrating to a new VFX and Entity system — earlier builds may be more stable.\
All pixel art is hand-drawn by me (a programmer) using a mouse.

Here's an old demo with worse lighting and post-processing effects:

The code and assets in this project are not free for public use or redistribution.\
This repository is published as a technical demo and proof of work, not as public domain.
